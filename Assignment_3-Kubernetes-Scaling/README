## Exercise 1

### a. Instead of "Hello from Python Flask!", the flask-hello container will return the value of the MESSAGE environment variable when someone uses the service (use Python's os.getenv). Provide the new Dockerfile and hello.py. Build and upload the new container to Docker Hub.

Just added **ENV MESSAGE="..." on the dockerfile

To build and upload the new image to Docker Hub

> docker login -u epap011

> sudo docker build -t "flask-env-var-image" .

> docker tag flask-env-var-image epap011/flask-env-var:latest 

> docker push epap011/flask-env-var:latest

### b. Provide two YAMLs to deploy the above container with all necessary resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress), so that "This is the first service!" is returned when someone visits the /first endpoint, and "This is the second service!" when someone visits the /second.

first.yaml: Deployment & Service of the irst service  
second.yaml: Deployment & Service of the second service   
ingress.yaml: Ingress


### c. Provide the commands needed to test the above two services with minikube (from running minikube, to curl or wget commands to use the services). Assume that the first deployment is in first.yaml and the second in second.yaml.

Apply Deployment, Service and Ingress resources  
> kubectl apply -f first.yaml -f second.yaml -f ingress.yaml  

Make sure that ingress addon is enabled
> minikube addons enable ingress  

Get the minikube ip  
> minikube ip  
Output: 192.168.49.2

Visit the /first endpoint  
> curl http://192.168.49.2/first  
Output: This is the first service  

Visit the /second endpoint  
> curl http://192.168.49.2/second  
Output: This is the second service
